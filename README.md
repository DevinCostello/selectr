# [Selectr.](https://selectr.onrender.com/)

Selectr is a simple 'To-Do' or list making app, where the user can choose a random item in each list. 
This would be most helpful for people who are indecisive and can't choose what movie to watch, book to read, etc.
All changes to lists and stored in local storage so users can come back to their lists at any time without the need to create an account.


I had a few specific goals in mind when making this project:

- Create a simple app to learn the basics of Typescript with React  
- Use and better familiarise myself with commonly used React Hooks
- Manage state between components without the use of a 3rd-party library

The project itself is about as simple as it gets, but I’m satisfied with both the finished project and the lessons I’ve learned through creating it.
